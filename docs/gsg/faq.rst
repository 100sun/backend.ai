   * - Product
     - Role
     - Problem and Solution

   * - Apache Zeppelin, Jupyter Notebook
     - Notebook-style document + code *front-ends*
     - Insecure host resource sharing

   * - **Backend.AI**
     - Pluggable *back-end* to any front-ends
     - Built for multi-tenancy: scalable and better isolation
